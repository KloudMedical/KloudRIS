# KloudRIS
RADIOLOGY INFORMATION SYSTEM & PRACTICE MANAGEMENT SOLUTION

# What Is A RIS?
A radiology information system aka a RIS is a special kind of networked electronic health record (EHR) software, designed specifically for radiology as its workflows are quite different from most other medical specialties. It is a sophisticated data driven, networked system that hospital imaging departments and radiology practices use to manage the entire patient life cycle from order referral to report distribution.

# Overview
KloudRIS is the first open source, multi-tenant, multilingual, web-based, outpatient radiology information system (RIS) and electronic medical records (EMR) solution to manage the entire radiology enterprise workflow from a browser, from any location, and from any device. It is also a labor of love as well as a work in progress... Some benefits of an open source web-based RIS are as follows:

* Open source! The source code is available and you are in control.
* Browser based and platform independent.
* No vendor-lock. Migrate at any time to another platform of your choosing.
* You own your data whether itâ€™s in the cloud or on-premise.
* Adapts to your needs instead of bending to the demands of your proprietary vendor.
* Can easily integrate with your favorite PACS and medical image viewer.
* Obviates the need for crushingly expensive and overpriced RIS systems.

# Features
## MULTI-TENANCY ARCHITECTURE

KloudRIS radiology information system comes with a built-in ELF (Entities (corporate), Locations, Facilities) multi-tenancy system that allows for an unlimited number of companies to set up and manage shop in a single environment, collaborate, or keep records completely isolated. The system can be deployed as a single internal RIS environment, or a cloud-based corporate, or multi-corporate one - making it also invaluable for teaching hospitals and collaborating research facilities.

## MULTILINGUAL - TRANSLATION READY
KloudRIS has all the resource files ready for language translation. To add a new language, simply duplicate the resource files folder, rename it to the new language designation and start translating or submit the files to a professional translation service.

## PHYSICIAN PORTAL
The Physician Portal allows for easy and intuitive submission of new orders. Physicians are provided live, searchable, up-to-the-minute imaging and reporting information, along with preliminary studies, signed reports, report sharing, and critical findings for all of their patients. The easy and intuitive interface of the physician portal environment also helps to save time by automating new order submissions and form filling to a large extent. The sharing portal allows physicians to share deanonymized/anonymized reports with colleagues and other experts in the field through a temporary secure system. Files are available for retrieval for 48 hrs., after which they are automatically destroyed.

## PATIENT PORTAL
Simple, straight forward, downloadable / printable access to diagnostic reports, critical findings, and diagnostic images. Just like the physician portal, patients are also provided live, up-to-the-minute imaging and reporting information.

## BILLING PORTAL
Since most radiology clinics and hospitals hire out their medical billing, KloudRIS focuses on gathering and making available all required data like orders, patient, insurance, diagnostic reports, totals, payments, payment status info as well as all related medical codes. It provides a searchable, straight forward interface with all the data ready for print, fax, and download.

## SECURITY & USER MANAGEMENT
KloudRIS comes with a multi-layer security and user management system complete with fully customizable user roles, page roles and content authorization.

## TRAINING DATABASE
Yup, we thought of that too. A training database is an essential component for training staff, management, and IT personnel -- not just before using KloudRIS for the first time, but ongoing as the need demands it.

## ORDERS & SCHEDULING
Order referrals are easily processed and scheduled through the Order Requests interface. Processing incoming requests is streamlined and mostly automated with import helpers for every section of the form. Orders can also be scheduled and edited through the calendar scheduling interfaces.

## CALENDAR & MODALITY SCHEDULING
KloudRIS comes with a calendar scheduling interface with the expected day, week, month layout as well as a resources a.k.a. modality view interface displaying all modalities and their schedules. Complete with search, drag and drop, modality schedules, recurring events, time and modality blocking functionality.

## PATIENT WORKFLOW
A multi-tabbed table layout with every patient workflow status that allows the hard working people in the bullpen to manage the entire patient cycle from appointment scheduling to patient checkout.

## ORDER, PATIENT & PHYSICIAN MERGE
The ability to merge duplicate patient accounts is a frequently requested and invaluable functionality in any electronic medical record software. We have taken the liberty to implement it not just for patient accounts, but for orders and physicians as well.

## TECHNOLOGIST WORKLIST
Technologists are provided with a universal worklist interface spanning across all affiliated locations and facilities with access to all required patient data. They can create and manage custom worklists based on search results and criteria, modality type, facility etc.. Lists can be pinned or saved as bookmarks.

## RADIOLOGIST WORKLIST + DICTATION
Just like technologists, radiologists are also provided a universal worklist environment. They can read and dictate studies from any affiliated facility and from any location. Instant access to all patient, order, and procedure info, tech notes, priors, bookmarks, notes creation /sharing, suspending studies, and bulk signing - makes this flexible interface a pleasure to use.

## TRANSCRIPTIONIST WORKLIST
Just like radiologists, transcriptionists are also provided a universal worklist environment so they can work closely with radiologists across multiple facilities.

## MODALITY WORKLIST DATABASE
The Modality Worklist (MWL) is an essential component of the radiology workflow that allows primary imaging equipment (modalities) to be informed (through query via standard C-Find) of the next-in-line procedure, study details, and patient demographics. The benefits are great as it eliminates or reduces Operator Time and Data Entry Errors, and Improves Data Consistency. KloudRIS comes with a modality worklist database separate from the primary database, that is configured to work with and to be managed by the application. The MWL database can be deployed alongside the primary database or moved to a modality worklist server.

## MODALITY WORKLIST GATEWAY
The Modality Worklist Gateway is a sophisticated cross platform virtual machine environment that offers an out-of-the-box solution to communicate securely with the radiology information system (RIS), whether the RIS is deployed on the local network or in the cloud. It is also a fully functional PACS / DICOM server system but can be used as a PACS router to work with your established image storage software.

## MQSA MAMMOGRAPHY MODULE
Proper tracking and reporting of breast imaging in compliance with MQSA is an essential component of Mammography. KloudRIS is complete with automated Lay Letters, Reminder Letters, Clinical Mammography Tracking for Category 0 and Biopsy 4-5, Biopsy Tracking Reports, Outcome Results Reports, and BI-RAD Counts by RAD Reports.

## AUDITING - USER ACTIVITY LOGS
Organizations must perform security audits using audit trails and audit logs that offer a back-end view of system use. Audit trails and logs record key activities, showing system threads of access, modifications, and transactions. KloudRIS is in compliance with Section 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(c), and Section 164.312(1)(b) of HIPAA Security Rules.

## PATIENT NOTES & CATEGORIES
No doubt, notes are an integral part of patient management, not to mention a legal requirement. KloudRIS let's you create any number of notes and categories, directly or indirectly related to patient details, history, medical conditions, medications, orders, procedures, insurance or anything else you can think of. Searchable, printable, and clonable...

## PATIENT DOCUMENTS & CATEGORIES
Just like with patient notes, the searchable document management interface allows for unlimited documents and categories for every type of uploaded/scanned files and a wide range of file types. Streaming file upload enables users to upload large files efficiently without putting too much strain on the system. Files are organized and displayed based on categories.

## SITE FORMS & STANDARD PROCEDURES
Site Forms are facility specific forms required for patients and other business operations while Standard Procedures are procedures carried out by the facility. Each procedure may come with a set of required forms. KloudRIS allows you to upload and catalog all your forms and assign them to the relevant standard procedures - so when a particular procedure is chosen for an order, you are able to print all the relevant forms.

## INSURANCE COMPANIES & PLANS
Insurance companies and plans are an integral part of patient accounts and order procedures.

## CPT, ICD, LOINC & RADLEX CODES
CPT, ICD, LOINC and RadLex codes are an integral part of standard procedures. You can use which ever code set you prefer. KloudRIS comes with a very fast csv file import engine that allows for bulk import of the above codes. Codes can also be created and edited individually.

## REST API & KEYS
The REST API allows a limited, secure, software to server communication and query for certain types of data that may be useful for some custom setups.

## LIBRARY FOR FILM IMAGES
While not as common as digital images, films are still used by many radiology clinics. Keeping track of the whereabouts of these images can get messy. KloudRIS provides a friendly library management system so you always know all the details.

## AND SO MUCH MORE...
The above list is just a sample of the more important aspects of KloudRIS.
